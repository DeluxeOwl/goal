Features:
- some kind of namespace or object and import mechanism
- math and rand primitives
- regexp primitives
- proper io (open/read/write/close/defer?)
- date and time
- array shift primitives (maybe bitwise operations too)
- use general x#y array case for something
- maybe triadic amend with .
- try-like statement (maybe ')
- rename eval from . to "eval" and reuse . for something?

Tests:
- improve test coverage and fix any remaining bugs in corner cases

Optimizations:
- more special code for common op/ and op\
- use sorted flag for arrays
- improve some special and general cases in self-search functions
- maybe improve liveness analysis (though simple, already good enough)
